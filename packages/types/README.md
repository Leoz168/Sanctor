# Shared Types

Common type definitions shared between frontend and backend.

## TypeScript Types (for Frontend)

See `types.ts` for React/TypeScript type definitions.

## Go Types (for Backend)

See `types.go` for Go struct definitions.

## Keeping Types in Sync

When adding or modifying types:
1. Update both TypeScript and Go definitions
2. Ensure field names and types match
3. Use consistent naming conventions
